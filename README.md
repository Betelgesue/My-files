# My-files

Hello

Here is some basic info about the repository:

## Python 
The Python folder contains files with sample code I want to share.

Customers Dataset - contains main Jupyter Source file and additional 3 xlsx files wtih dummy data. The file uses pandas, numpy and matplotlib to perform data manipulation and create visualizations.

Stocks - contains one Jupyter Source file. It uses pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and data_reader to perform some data manipulation operations and visualization on chosen historic stocks data.

War game - a logical card game. It is very similar to multiple python games that can be found on the internet, but I added some user interaction, code timing and informations to display during the game.

Web Scraping - there are 2 files in folder. Scraping_empik_autorzy takes a list of authors from top 60 books sold im empik and allows you to search for their books. Scraping_fantasy_empik creates a list of best selling books with price and author info, and saves it in "Pliki" folder in separate files (set to perform every 10 seconds).

## Visualizations
The visualizations folder contains two files with advanced dashboards created in MS excel and one file with VBA automatization.
